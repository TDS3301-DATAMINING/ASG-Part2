# Part 2: ASSOCIATION RULE MINING

You can access the dataset at this [link](https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/ExtendedBakery).

## Q1: Objectives

The domain of this data sets is about the large set of transactional data from a bakery chain which has a menu of about 40 pastry items and 10 coffee drinks. This bakery chain has a several locations in West Coast of United State which includes California, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada. In the dataset, there is a list of shopping baskets which contain what have been purchased by the customers. Hence, we can make use of this information to find the patterns that occur frequently by applying association rule mining using Apriori algorithm. 

There are many potential benefits can be derived from these association rules. This includes extracting the marketing information that can be used to improve business. For instance, the bakery shop would improve their product placement according to frequent items purchased by the customers. This creates convenience for customers as they can reach their preferred items once they entered the shop or just grab the item without having to look and search for it. Besides that, the frequent items that have higher confidence in the basket can be combined together with lower confidence as a bundle to push the sales of the items that are not popular. 

Other than that, we can group items with high correlations for catalog creation. This can attract more customer at the first sight as they can likely find whatever relevant items they were to buy in a short amount of time. Different promotion or discount coupon can also be integrated as part of the catalog for bundle discounts.  

Furthermore, recommendation will also be more effective when we have the patterns to do advertising on social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. For customers who have not tried certain items from the bakery shop could be attracted by seeing what other customers have bought together when they visit the shop. Reputation of different items would be improved as they are putting together. 

In addition to that, we can determine what items would be affected if the shop discontinued a certain item. By having the patterns of different items as an antecedent and consequent we can know what is important in the store and make sure it is always served in the top quality so that it will not affect the sales. Therefore, the risk of losing customers will be reduced and the prevention will be improved.
